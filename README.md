# Analyzing-OKC-Thunder

Project Purpose/Goal: 
Sam Presti, the Oklahoma City Thunder's GM, orchestrated a rebuild post-2020 by trading key players for future draft picks and focusing on developing young talent like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He prioritized financial flexibility, emphasized patience, and built a long-term vision to position the team for sustained success in the future. This project will aim to find out which of the players meet the high-value standard. 

Methodology: 
- I will use two datasets from each season, Per Game stats and Advanced stats.
- Per game statistics in basketball (points per game, assists, blocks, and steals) are counted to provide a standardized measure of player performance across different games and enable easy comparison between players.
- Advanced Stats are a way to study basketball through objective analysis. It is a more in-depth way to look at a simple box score, and more accurately evaluates the skill and production of a player or team (i.e. effective field goal percentage (eFG%), true shooting percentage (TS%), (on-court/off-court) plusâ€“minus, adjusted plus-minus (APM), real plus/minus (RPM), player efficiency rating (PER), offense efficiency rating, offensive rating, defensive rating, similarity score, tendex, etc.).
